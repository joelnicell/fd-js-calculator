## Frontend Development - Mayerfeld Consulting: Calculator

preview at: https://joelnicell.github.io/fd-js-calculator/

A calculator app made using purely Vanilla HTML, CSS and Javascript for the Mayerfeld Consulting Frontend Development course.

The app is a functioning calculator with keyboard input support, light and dark mode support, and summary page as well.

This tested and honed skills for many useful web principles such as error handling, handling logic for many event types (symbols, numbers, chaining operations etc.), css grid, and animated elements.
