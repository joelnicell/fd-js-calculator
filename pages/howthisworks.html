                <h1 class="addition-title">➕ Addition</h1>
                    <p class="addition">One day, Number 3 was walking down the street when he saw Number 5 looking lonely.</p>
                    <p class="addition">- “Hey,” said 3, “you look like you could use some company.” 5 smiled.</p>
                    <p class="addition">- “Yeah, I’ve been feeling a little... incomplete.”</p>
                    <p class="addition">So they decided to hang out together. The moment they did, something magical happened — they fused into a brand-new number: 8.</p>
                    <p class="addition">- “Whoa,” said 3.</p>
                    <p class="addition">- “Yeah,” said 5, “I guess we add up pretty well.”</p>
                    <h3 class="addition">Moral of the story: Addition is just numbers making new friends.</h3>
               
                <h1 class="substraction-title">➖ Substraction</h1>
                    <p>One sunny day, Number 10 was proudly walking around, showing off how big he was. He met Number 4, who looked a bit mischievous.</p>
                    <p>- “Hey, 10,” said 4, “you’ve got too much stuff. Let me help you lighten the load.”</p>
                    <p>Before 10 could answer, 4 quickly took away part of him.</p>
                    <p>- “Hey! Where did the rest of me go?” cried 10.</p>
                    <p>- “Don’t worry,” said 4, “you’re still you… just a smaller, sleeker version. You’re 6 now!”</p>
                    <p>10 sighed. “I guess you could say… you really took something off my mind.”.</p>
                    <h3>Moral of the story: Subtraction is just numbers going on a little diet.</h3>

                <h1 class="multiply-title">✖️ Multiplication</h1>
                    <p>One day, Number 3 was hanging out with his friend Number 4.</p>
                    <p>They were bored, so 4 said:</p>
                    <p>- “Hey, instead of just standing around, let’s make more of us!”</p>
                    <p>So they started cloning themselves — 3 made 4 copies of himself.</p>
                    <p>Suddenly, there were 12 threes running around. 3 looked around in shock.</p>
                    <p>- “Whoa… this escalated quickly.”</p>
                    <p>4 laughed:</p>
                    <p>- “That’s multiplication for you — we don’t just add… we explode the numbers!”</p>
                    <h3>Moral of the story: Multiplication is what happens when numbers throw a party and everyone brings copies of themselves.</h3>
                   
                    <h1 class="division-title">➗ Division</h1>
                    <p>One day, Number 12 was hanging out with its friend Number 6.</p>
                    <p>They were getting bored, so 6 said:</p>
                    <p>- "Hey, instead of just standing here, why don't we share what we've got?"</p>
                    <p>So they decided to split up. 12 divided itself by 6.</p>
                    <p>Suddenly, there were two 6s standing next to each other. 12 looked around and said:</p>
                    <p>- "Whoa... this is a bit less crowded."</p>
                    <p>6 chuckled:</p>
                    <p>- "That’s division for you — we take what we've got and make it smaller, but still the same total!"</p>
                    <h3>Moral of the story: Division is like splitting a pizza — everyone gets a slice, but the total amount stays the same.</h3>
